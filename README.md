# 1Word

> A 1 Word Story Game

1Word is a 1 word story game where players take turns in adding a single word to a story.

1Word is implemented with Websockets, Node.js and Vue.js

## Why

A little learning project for me, acting as a proof-of-concept for connection pooling and management, and (relatively) high-frequency messaging/broadcasting in Websockets.

## Setup

1. Start the websocket server 
```
node server
```

2. Start the Vue-js 
```
npm run dev
```

3. Open a couple of browser tabs and start writing!

## Ideas

  - IndexDB as decentralized datastore O.o
